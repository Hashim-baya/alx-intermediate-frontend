# 0-installation-script: SASS Installation Steps

# This script documents the steps taken to install and set up SASS based on the project requirements.

# 1. Project Directory Setup (Assumed completed before running this script)
#    cd alx-intermediate-frontend
#    mkdir 0x03-sass_scss
#    cd 0x03-sass_scss

# 2. Node.js Installation (Optional, only if Node.js is not already installed)
#    If Node.js v20.16 was required and not present, the following steps were taken:
#    echo "Installing Node.js v20.16 using NVM..."
#    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
#    (Note: A terminal restart is necessary after NVM installation. Use 'exit' and reopen.)

# 3. SASS Installation via npm
#    Assuming Node.js is installed and the terminal is functional, SASS is installed using npm.
#    The specific version 3.7.4 was requested in the instructions.

echo "Installing SASS via npm..."
# Note: npm uses @ for specific versions (e.g., package@version).
npm install sass@3.7.4

# 4. Verify SASS Installation
#    Check if the sass command is available and confirm the installed version.

# This step attempts to run a command typically used for global installation verification.
# If 'npm install' was used without '-g', the executable is usually in node_modules/.bin/sass
echo "Verifying SASS installation..."
# If installed locally:
# ./node_modules/.bin/sass --version

# If installed globally (recommended for command line usage):
# sass --version

echo "SASS installation steps documented."
